**Feedback**
Course GPA: 7.0 - High Distinction
> Contribution: <br>18/20 <br>
Significant progress made, filling out the storyboard was a good display of leadership. <br>

> Quality: 16/20 <br>
Work is completed to a high standard<br>
Code was of a good quality but improvements such as access modifiers and not having commented out code would help to improve quality. <br>

> Integration:   12/15 <br>
Minimal opportunity for integration but where possible, done to a high standard. <br>
Good use of task tickets. <br>

> Documentation: 20/25 <br>
Documentation of work in the form of a story board is well done. <br>
Good documentation of code and design decisions in the wiki <br>

> Participation: 19/20 <br>
Worked very well with the your team and other teams on ticket comments <br>Fantastic to see the initiative of the sidebar restructure!
