Significant progress made, filling out the storyboard was a good display of leadership. <br>

Code was of a good quality but improvements such as access modifiers and not having commented out code would help to improve quality. <br>

Minimal opportunity for integration but where possible, done to a high standard. <br>
Good use of task tickets. <br>
